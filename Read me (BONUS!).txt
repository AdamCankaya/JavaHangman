This is a group submission from Adam Cankaya, Nathalie Blume, and Matt LaFollette

Hangman 1.0 is the complete assignment plus:

	- Extra credit: colored text added
	- Extra credit: clever computer player:
	 	- prioritizes vowels
		- chcks for common letter combinations
		- switches from frequency to random after set number of turns

Hangman 1.1 contains all of 1.0 code plus sounds:

	- Extra credit: Sounds:
		- Click sound for when human players hit the submission button
		- Positive/negative buzzer sounds for when any player guesses a letter either right or wrong
		- Applause sound when any player wins a game

	Note: This sound code contains "import sun.audio.*" which works fine for me (Adam), but causes a compilation error
	for Nathalie and Matt. I am using Windows 7 x64, Java JDK7 and Eclipse 3.3.2. I am including the two versions of the code
	in case you also cannot compile the code with sound added.
